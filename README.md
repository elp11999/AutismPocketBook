                Social: An individual with this diagnosis will have deficits in social communication that cause them noticeable impairments.  They show difficulties with starting social interactions and have difficulties with properly interacting with peers.   They will likely be verbal, but could have difficulties with using language in a proper manner.

                Behavior/Interest:  An individual with this diagnosis will have repetitive type behaviors and routines/rituals that interfere with day-to-day life.  This can include things such as difficulty with transitions and inflexible behaviors.

            * Level 2: Requiring Substantial Support
                Social: An individual with this diagnosis will have deficits in social communication, that will include both verbal and nonverbal.  These impairments are noticeable even with extra supports in place for the individual.  The individual will have difficulties with starting social interactions and have difficulties with properly interacting with peers.

This can include things such as difficulty with transitions and inflexible behaviors.  These behaviors will however be frequent enough to be noticed by those around them.  When these behaviors are interrupted, the individual will become frustrated and have difficulty with being redirected from the item of interest.

            * Level 3: Requiring Very Substantial Support
                Social: An individual with this diagnosis will have severe deficits in social communication, that will include both verbal and nonverbal communication.
